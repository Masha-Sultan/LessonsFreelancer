	<h1>Evolution Of The Mazda MX-5 Miata</h1>
</header>

<body>
	<h2>Over time, Mazda has refined the MX-5 Miataâ€™s formula, making it simpler to drive, more reliable, and ultimately
		more gorgeous.</h2>
	<img src="img/mazda-mx-5-evolution.jpg" alt="Evolution of Miata">

	<p class="top"> Mazda unveiled a tiny, affordable sports car in <mark>February 1989</mark> at the <a	href="https://www.chicagoautoshow.com/concepts/vehicle/1989/pontiac/stinger/" target="_blank">Chicago Auto
		Show</a>, and it went on to become the world's best-selling two-seat convertible. The Mazda MX-5 Miata was
		clearly influenced by vintage British and Italian roadsters of the '60s, while its design is directly based on the
		Lotus Elan, as can be seen in its design cues.<span class="topnext">That said, it's our pleasure to present to you the most fascinating details regarding the introduction and evolution of the iconic Mazda MX-5 Miata.</span></p>
	<p class="topnext">Due to their tiny sizes, two-seater convertibles are able to use smaller, lighter motors, and all these attributes
		were present in the Mazda MX-5 Miata. People from all walks of life have admired the model ever since it was first
		introduced in 1989, as it continuously provides the kind of driving enjoyment that can only be gotten in a
		lightweight sports car.</p>
