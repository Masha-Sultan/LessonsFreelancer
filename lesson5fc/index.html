			<h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
			<p class="top_one">Mazda's Adaptive LED Headlamps provide the ultimate in headlight technology, lighting up the road ahead as if it were daytime and allowing anybody to enjoy safe and stress-free driving at any time of day.</p>
			<p class="top_two">The system increases visibility at night to help drivers stay vigilant by combining three technologies: Glare-free High Beams, which automatically dim part of the illuminated area to avoid dazzling other drivers; Wide-range Low Beams, which light up a wider area at low speeds; and Highway mode, which helps you see further when travelling at speed.</p>

			<h2>safety</h2>
			<p class="middle_one">When traveling at speeds of 65kph or faster, this available system gives you audible and visual warnings when it detects that your vehicle is about to unintentionally depart from its lane.</p>

			<h2>EXPRESSIVE DETAILS</h2>
			<span class="bottom_one">The position of the LED low beam, the parabolic-type LED high beam and the turn signal layout produce more intensity and better visibility for better driving.</span>
			<h2>A TREAT FOR THE SENSES</h2>
			<p class="bottom_two">The exhilaration of the Mazda MX-5 convertible is more than the sensation of carving through S-curves with the wind in your hair. Itâ€™s an all-encompassing experience, and it starts exactly at the moment you see it.</p>
